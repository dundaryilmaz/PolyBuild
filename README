  COMPILING

  Two makefiles provided for gfortran and intel fortran compilers. These are
  Makefile.gfortran      : Makefile for gcc/gfortran compilers.
  Makefile.ifort         : Makefile for intel fortran compilers.

  Enter the source directory:

  cd Src

  Copy appropriate make file to file name makefile:

   cp Makefile.gfortran makefile

  Clean the source directory:
  
   make clean
  
  Compile the source code:

   make

  This will create an executable file " polybuild " and it will copy this file to the test folder

   cp polybuild ../Test
 
  and  copy polybuild to local bin folder if it exist:

   cp polybuild ~/bin/
  
  That completes building the source code.


  USAGE:
 
  Polybuild will need a configuration file which should be supplied via command line to execute:

  polybuild config.cb

  Configuration file contains setup information for the polybuild.

  There are three modes of the program.

  1- Polymer Building Mode

  2- Composite Building Mode

  3- Fiber Building Mode

  These three modes can be combined except composite and fiber modes. Fiber modes can only be combined with Polymer mode.

  1- Polymer Building Mode:
