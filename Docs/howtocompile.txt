Polybuild User Manual

1- Compile and Install
Compiling chrpak and geometry libraries.
There are two external libraries requierd to compile polybuild. source code is also located at the Libraries folder.
If lcharpak.a and lgeometry.a files are not compatible with your system you need to compile these two libraries from the source code.

Creating lchrpak.a and lgeometry.a:
To create the library file first you need to compile f90split.f90

gfortran f90split.f90 -o f90split

Make the shell script chrpak.sh executable:
chmod +x chrpak.sh
Run the shell script :
./chrpak.sh

Creating lgeometry.a is similar. You need to run shell script geometry.sh this time.
chmod +x geometry.sh
./geometry.sh


Compiling polybuild is easy. Default compiler is Intel Fortran. In the makefile setting
F90=gfortran 
will set the GNU/Gfortran as the Fortran compiler. For best results gcc version > 5.0 recommended.

Change the directory to Src
cd Src
Compile the source codes with:
make.
If everything goes well you should have the executable polybuild.
